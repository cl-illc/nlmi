    "Note that in the second line, we look for paths of size $i-1$ (which my have ended in one of $t$ possible previous tags) and we try to extend them with tag $j$. The probability of each hypothetical extension is the probability of the path we mean to extend $\\alpha(i-1, p)$ times the joint parameters associated with the extension. That is, continuing from previous class $C_{i-1}=p$ with current class $C_i=j$ (that is a transition parameter), and generating the current word $X_i=x_i$ from the current class $C_i=j$ ( that is an emission parameter).\n",

    "Note that the recursive function takes 2 inputs, $i$ which ranges from 1 to $n$, and $j$ which ranges from 1 to $t$. Thus we need to make at most $nt$ calls to this function. But also note that each time we call it, we have to solve (in the second line) a maximisation over $t$ possible assignments of the previous tag. Therefore the overall complexity of the algorithm is $O(nt^2)$. That's quite an improvement from $O(t^n)$, isn't it?\n",

You can use this implementation if you want to experiment with PTB and Brown corpus in the exercises below. Read the implementation carefully to learn from it. We have provided extensive documentation.\n",
