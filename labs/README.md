If you are enrolled in the course, use the material on Canvas instead.
Otherwise, feel free to check our labs out. 

* Warning: even though Github renders ipynb files, we recommend you clone the repository and run `jupyter notebook`. We make use of LaTeX code that Github does not know how to render properly.
